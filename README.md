# Prezentr (alpha)

An lively HTML5 slideshow build with AngularJS and Ratchet.

### TODOs

* Separate React presentation from application
* Fix supervisord and nginx configuration in vagrant bootstrap
* Big code cleanup
* Use NgViews instead of separate files
* index.php -> index.html (doesn't really need server) [requires nginx config for server mode]
* Fix slide offset in FireFox
* Test on IE (lol)
