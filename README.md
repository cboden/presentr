# Prezentr (alpha)

The new, lively, hip(ster) HTML5 slideshow build with AngularJS and Ratchet.

### TODOs

* Separate React presentation from application
* Big code cleanup
* Fix slide offset in FireFox
* Test on IE (lol)
* notes directive, notes included in slide, only show when appropriate url
* pub/sub is completely messed up because controllers are always loaded - need to be active when slide is
* better authentication method for remote control
* ask questions through client to speaker
